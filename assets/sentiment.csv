"The website was brilliantly designed. Prices are so low it's hard to believe. The batteries that I ordered for my smartphone appear to be OEM, perfect condition as promised. There was a delay in the delivery of my oroducts, which wasn't the fault of a4c, as it appears that the packaging was damaged in shipping. Also, one item ordered wasn't received when delivery was received,  but I have every confidence that customer support will make good on the issue when I notify them. I'd recommend them to friends.",0,1,0

"The order took 29 days to get to Hawaii.  When it finally got here, it was packed in a flimsy box. The boc itself had grease all over it. When I opened, there was no packing material and everyone of the 8 bags was open from the bottom.  The chips were all over the box and they were stale because of the open bag and the time it took to ship. This is not a reflection of the chips which are normally great but don't order them from here.",0,0,1
Excellent phone for the $200 price. Its almost a month now and the phone is working great. Didn't face any issue with bluetooth as other customer complained about it. Battery life is good for regular usage it is holding charge upto a week. Standby is about 3 weeks. Checked all features and so far everything working great. Great looks and ultra slim. Why pay so much for iphone or samsung or htc...,1,0,0

"My family and I have used Manuka Honey for all types of tummy<br />and skin problems. I used it yesterday when I caught a flu type virus and it was a lifesaver. Last week I put it on my lip for a coldsore and it worked great.  I don't know why more people haven't heard of it. It really is a first aid product, so I use other honey<br />for tea.  I take some before I take pills that upset my stomach; I also give it to friends as gifts.I've used it for Irritable bowel<br />syndrome (IBS).  Research this wonderful product,  and you'll never go back to over the counter products.",0,1,0
